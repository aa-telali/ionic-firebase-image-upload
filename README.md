## Upload Images to Firebase Storage from your Ionic app

This app shows how to use Firebase Storage from an Ionic app.

In Firebase Storage files can be either public or protected using security rules to determine who has access to them.

We included examples of both cases: a section with public files visible to everyone and a private section, with authentication so the files can restrict access to content by user. The app includes the code to upload, list, and delete protected files.
